# this would let git manage the file endings automatically
# to be save this will be commented
# * text=auto
# if used it is very important to set the file types
# which should not be normalized manually (like svg, jpg, etc)
# they should be set to binary

# These files should be ignored as it pertains to line-endings
# because they are binary or should be treated as binary
# Since auto normalize is deactivated all these could be commented too.
# needed if * text=auto is used
# *.FCStd binary
# *.jpg binary
# *.png binary
# *.pyc binary
# *.qm binary
# *.svg binary


# These files will always be checked out with CRLF, i.e. windows-style line endings. This
# really should not be needed...
# *.SomeWindowsFileExtensionThatReallyRequiresCRLFEvenInLinux eol=crlf


# use git to manually correct the file endings
# git add --renormalize .
